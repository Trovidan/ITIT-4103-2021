# Assignment 6
  - Considering the IRIS dataset discussed in previous assignment, apply EM algorithm to cluster the data (without considering the output labels) Use the same dataset for clustering using K-means algorithm. Compare the results of these two algorithms.
  - Apply PCA algorithm to obtain first two principal components and perform the clustering using both algorithms on the resultant data.  Compare the results of these two algorithms.
